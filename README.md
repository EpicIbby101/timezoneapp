# Timezone Buddy - A time calculator
This app is designed to calculate the best time for two people from different timezones to call or talk to each other without disrupting their circadian rhythm and sleep patterns.

Built on React using Next.js and Tailwind for app styling.
## Features

- Using a mix of simple and complex logics and libraries, calculate the best times for two people from different timezones to talk to each other.
- Sleep schedule and circadian rhythm taken into consideration. Adjustments made from total available time to account for the time before bed where it's advise to not use phones
- Takes your timezone and the other person's and calculates the time difference
- Responsive design, mobile resolution friendly

## Current issues to fix
- I need to add a share button
- I need to optimise the UI to make it look better
- I could add a button to convert the times between 12hr and 24hr
- I need to optimise the notification for no common times found
